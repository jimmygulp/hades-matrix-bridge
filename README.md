# Hades Matrix Bridge

This is the start of an implementation of a Matrix Bridge for connecting to Hades talker (hades-talker.org 6660).  

This is a work in progress, and a successor to the [mx-puppet-hades](hhttps://github.com/neilsb/mx-puppet-hades) project.

It's pretty rough round the edges, with a pile of things still needing fixed.  But it does work in the most basic sense.
